🛠️ Tech Stack

    HTML5 – Semantic structure and canvas element

    CSS3 – Styling and responsive layout

    JavaScript (ES6) – Core gameplay mechanics, event handling, and game loop

💡 Why “Vanilla”?

This project demonstrates how to build a fully functional game without frameworks or engines, focusing on:

    Core JavaScript concepts: classes, modules, events

    Game development fundamentals: rendering, timing, collision

    Clean and modular code ideal for learning and expansion

✔️ Contribute & Extend

    Add new levels, characters, sound effects, or features like scoring or difficulty levels

    Refactor with ESModules or build tools (bundlers, TypeScript, etc.)

    Mobile support: add touch/mouse input handling
